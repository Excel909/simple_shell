This is a shell program developed by Excellent Ayomide Badejo (GitHub: Excel909, Email: excellentayomide@gmail.com). The goal is to understand and implement a basic shell program, which interprets commands and executes them.

Steps Taken
Research and Understanding: Studied basic shell concepts, including command parsing, process handling, and input/output redirection.

Design and Planning: Outlined the structure and functionality of the shell program, deciding on user interface and command execution logic.

Implementation: Wrote code to parse user input, execute commands, manage processes, and handle input/output redirection.

Testing: Created test cases to ensure the shell program behaved as expected.

Debugging and Optimization: Debugged issues and optimized code for better performance and efficiency.

Documentation: Documented usage, features, and inner workings of the shell program, including comments in the code and this README file.

Conclusion
Building this shell program was a valuable learning experience, providing insight into operating system concepts and programming fundamentals. It improved understanding of process management, command execution, and input/output handling. Future plans include enhancing the project and exploring advanced shell functionalities.# simple_shell
